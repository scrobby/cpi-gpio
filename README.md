# cpi-gpio
An extension of pi-gpio, allowing for event-driven callbacks from digital inputs.

## Background
I am currently using a Raspberry Pi Zero W and trying to implement some basic GPIO tasks within Node.js. The best library I found for this purpose was pi-gpio as it doesn't require root access, like rpi-gpio does, and appears to function much better than other libraries such as onoff.
